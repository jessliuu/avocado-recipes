            "Beautiful aromas of sassafras, mocha and black licorice demonstrate the unique, bold personality of the Russian River Valley. Distinct flavors of brambly fruit, sweet oak and white pepper lead to a broad, balanced wine with food-friendly acidity. Russian River's warm, sunny days and cool foggy nights are optimal for Pinot Noir – the wines have great texture and weight without being overdone or losing their natural acidity. The classic deep, dark aromas and flavors the Russian River is known for shine through in this wine.",

      "Note: needs 30 minutes in fridge. \r\n1. Boil a kettle of water for melting the chocolate in a double boiler.\r\n2. Blend the avocado into a smooth consistency.\r\n3. COAT: Prepare coating ingredients in a bowl (raw cocoa, dessicated coconut, or ground almonds).\r\n4. Cut wax paper to fit into a tray or plate.\r\n5. COOK: Break the chocolate into smaller pieces and melt it in a double boiler over a low heat. Add the salt and vanilla essence. Remove from the heat once the chocolate has melted. Add the chocolate and cocoa powder to the blender with the avocado. Add brown sugar, to taste.\r\n6. Blend or mix the chocolate and avocado mix through until you have a smooth, thick, pudding-like consistency. Transfer the food processor bowl to the fridge for about 30 minutes.\r\n7. After 30 minutes, check the consistency - if it is still too soft to handle, put in fridge for another 5-10 minutes. When solid enough to handle, scoop up a little bit of the stiffened chocolate with a teaspoon and roll it in your hands into a smooth ball.\r\n8. Transfer the ball to the coating and roll it until it is completely covered. Place the covered ball on a tray or plate.\r\n9. Place the chocolate truffles back in the fridge and keep it chilled until serving.",

        "Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Muscadet are great choices for Crawfish. Though different seafoods can certainly call for different wines, generally a crisp, light-bodied white wine or a sparkling white wine will do the trick and not drown out any subtle flavors. The Trentadue La Storia Chardonnay with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.",

            "The 2014 Chardonnay, Sonoma Coast, is typical for the variety with aromas of apples, white peaches and citrus. With longer time in the glass nuanced aromas of nutmeg, slight toast and vanilla come to play along with suggestion of pineapple and ripe Meyer lemons. The mouth feel is crisp and restrained with clear minerality and purity of fruit. Rich, elegant and beautifully balanced.",

        "Salad works really well with Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Foley Estate Winery Sta. Rita Hills Chardonnay with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.",

        "Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Scallops. Chardonnay and chenin blanc are great matches for grilled or seared scallops. If your scallops are being matched with bacon or other cured meats, try a lightly chilled pinot noir. You could try Trentadue La Storia Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 25 dollars per bottle.",

            "The 2014 Chardonnay, Sonoma Coast, is typical for the variety with aromas of apples, white peaches and citrus. With longer time in the glass nuanced aromas of nutmeg, slight toast and vanilla come to play along with suggestion of pineapple and ripe Meyer lemons. The mouth feel is crisp and restrained with clear minerality and purity of fruit. Rich, elegant and beautifully balanced.",

Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.",

            "Grown in an appellation that experiences cool summers and mild winters, this Pinot Noir offers an exciting contrast to Coppola's California bottling, expressing a more delicate tannin structure and higher acidity that makes it elegant and well-proportioned. This wine reflects the essence of the appellation and flavors that make Oregon Pinot Noir so desirable.Light and stylish, the palate presents a freshly pickedquality, lively acidity, and well-balanced oak sweetness.This vintage is fruit forward with a satiny supple textureand ripe tannins. Thanks to careful barrel selection, notesof grilled almonds and toasted bread are beautifullyintegrated into the flavor matrix.",

        "Salad works really well with Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The A to Z Chardonnay with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.",

            "The 2010 A to Z Chardonnay opens with aromas of white flowers, tangerine, lime, quince, wet stone and minerals that develop further into nutmeg, honey, green apple with hints of ginger. A mineral laden attack is bright, mouthwatering and intense. The nuanced mid-palate carries on with flavors that mirror and amplify the aromatics. The finish is long, clean, crisp and juicy with flavors of honeysuckle, citrus and wet stone. This wine exemplifies classic Oregon steely Chardonnay. 2010 was an exceptional vintage for white wines in Oregon and this sophisticated terroir driven wine is no exception; bright, tangy and intense it will deliver over the next 5 years.",

            "For lovers of pure sensations we have created a 100% Pinot Noir cuvée with no dosage. It contains only the wine's natural residual sugar at less than 2g per bottle. Moreover, the use of an absolute minimum of sulphur gives the wine the freedom to express itself totally. On the nose there is crisp and at the same time ripe fruit. On the palate it is upright and pure, with abundant finesse and freshness.\nVermilion gold in color. Nose of freshly pressed black grapes, of red, white and citrus fruits. Ample palate with flesh of vineyard peach and bouquet of aromatic herbs. Small spicy notes in the finish. A fine, tightly knit Champagne of great purity.Ideal as an aperitif. The perfect accompaniment for seafood, sashimi or even soft goat's cheese.",

    instructions:
      "<ol><li>Cut the chicken thighs into one inch sized pieces.</li><li>Add about 2 teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of pepper. Or do what I always do for dishes that call for salt and pepper. I use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper. Give it a good sprinkle, about 1 tablespoon of it. Set aside to marinate for a couple of hours.</li><li>Slice the top of the tomatoes off.</li><li>Using a small spoon, scoop out the soft insides of the tomatoes. This reduces the moisture in the dish and prevents sogginess.</li><li>Chop the tomatoes up into small bits.</li><li>Chop the onions into small bits.</li><li>Place the onions and tomatoes in a large bowl.</li><li>Chop up a bunch of cilantro. Use as much or as little as you like.</li><li>Add the cilantro to the onions-tomatoes mixture. Toss together and set aside.</li><li>Cut a slit round an avocado, against its seed.</li><li>Holding each side of the cut avocado, twist the avocado open to reveal the seed.</li><li>Remove the seed and scoop out the flesh. Place the avocado flesh in a large bowl and mash it up evenly till it becomes creamy.</li><li>Add the tomatoes mixture to the avocados.</li><li>Combine well.</li><li>Squeeze in juice from one lemon.</li><li>Add a generous portion of salt to taste. About 1 to 2 teaspoons.</li><li>At this point, youll have guacamole. If you like, dish it up in a serving bowl and serve it with chips.</li><li>Now cook the chicken. Heat a pan with a few tablespoons of cooking oil till its very hot. It has to be very hot or the chicken wont brown.</li><li>Add the chicken to the pan. Be careful! Itll sizzle and splatter.</li><li>Turn the pieces over to brown the other side after a few minutes.</li><li>When the chicken are browned, remove them from the pan and set aside at a warm place.</li><li>Using a clean, dry pan, toast the tortillas one at a time on each side.</li><li>They are ready to be used when they are soft and warm.</li><li>Add a serving of the guacamole mixture.</li><li>Add a serving of the chicken.</li><li>Quickly wrap the burrito up. If it cools, the tortilla will crack and it would be impossible to roll it up.</li><li>Roll over once. Fold in the sides, and roll over again till its fully wrapped.</li><li>Serve immediately or wrap in aluminum foil and keep them in the oven till ready to eat.</li></ol>",

Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings.

        "Chocolate Cupcake can be paired with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.",

      "<p>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Poke your sweet potatoes with a fork and place them directly on the rack of your oven. Place a piece of foil on the rack below to reduce mess. Bake the sweet potatoes for 45-50 minutes or until tender. Times may vary depending on how hot your oven gets.Remove the potatoes from the oven and let stand at room temperature until they are cool enough to handle, about 20-30 minutes. Leave the oven on.While your potatoes are cooling, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue to cook the butter, stirring frequently, until brown bits begin to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5-6 minutes. Pay close attention as the butter can quickly go from brown to burnt in a matter of seconds. Once you see the brown bits forming and a nutty aroma fills the air, pull the butter from the heat immediately. Set aside.Cut the tops off of the sweet potatoes, lengthwise. Scoop the sweet potato flesh into a medium bowl, leaving the skins in tact. To the bowl, add the brown butter, 2 tablespoons of the fresh parsley, 3/4 of the chopped bacon, and 4 ounces of the goats cheese. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste and mash the ingredients together until combined. Scoop the filling back into the sweet potatoes.Place the potatoes on a baking sheet that has been lined with foil or parchment paper. Place them back in the oven to bake for 25 minutes.While your potatoes are baking for a second time, prepare your avocado cream. In the bowl of your food processor or blender, combine the avocados, sour cream and buttermilk. Add a dash of salt and pepper and pulse until completely smooth and creamy.Once your potatoes have baked, remove from oven. Sprinkle on the remaining parsley, bacon and goats cheese. Drizzle with avocado cream and serve immediately.Enjoy!I hope you enjoy this recipe for brown butter twice baked sweet potatoes!</p>",

      "Heat milk and sugar over medium heat in a medium saucepan until just comes to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the vanilla.\nHave ready a large bowl filled with ice and set a small metal bowl over the ice with a strainer set over it.\nPlace egg yolks in a medium bowl, lightly beaten.  Ladle some of the milk into the egg yolk, whisk it to prevent curdling.  Pour this mixture back into the rest of the milk in the saucepan.  Cook over low-medium heat until mixture is thick and can cover the back of a wooden spoon, about 4 to 8 minutes.\nPour the mixture over the strainer into the small bowl; stir in the yogurt.  Whisk the mixture over the ice bath until it cools completely.\nScoop the avocado meat and puree in a blender or food processor along with the lemon juice and some of the cooled custard.  Pour this mixture back to the rest of the custard, blend them together until it is thick and creamy.\nFreeze the custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturers instructions.  Halfway through the freezing process, fold in the chopped bittersweet chocolate.  Transfer the frozen yogurt into a freezer-safe container and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours.",

    instructions:
      "Chop off the stems of the swiss chard at the point where it meets the leaf. You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps.\nChop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.\nPlace the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.\nSpiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.\nTo assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.\nEnjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.\nThese wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.",

            "2007 was said to be the greatest vintage we would see in our lifetimes in California. This particular pinot noir from Anderson Valley is from the Balo Vineyard which is located directly across the road from the Golden Eye winery and vineyard. The vineyard is one of the rare pinot noir sites that insists on wanting to produce massive wines. The fruit and structure are huge. This wine will age beautifully for another 20 years. Enjoy now or buy a case to drink over the next decade or two.",

Add the eggs to the skillet and immediately sprinkle the bacon-cheese mixture over the top, spoon the drained salsa evenly over the top. Using a heat-proof spatula mix the frittata in small circular motions until the egg begins to set up into soft curds. Continue to cook, running the spatula around the edges of the frittata and lifting, letting the uncooked egg flow to the outer edges. (All this should take only a couple of minutes, start to finish.) When the frittata is mostly set with just the top looking a little runny, place the fritatta in the oven to finish cooking, about 3 minutes or so. Slide the frittata out onto a cutting board and cut into wedges for serving.\nAdd the frittata wedges and sliced avocado to the toasted rolls. Serve.",

        "Quesadilla can be paired with Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Byron Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 45 dollars per bottle.",

        "Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Salad. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Foley Johnson Carneros Chardonnay with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 23 dollars per bottle.",

            "Aromas are concentrated and complex in our 2016 Carneros Chardonnay. Notes of grilled peach, pear, buttered croissant, and vanilla set the stage for a rich, and full-bodied Chardonnay. The aromas expand on the palate with mouthwatering flavors of pear, apple crisp, honeysuckle, toasted coconut, and vanilla wafer. This wine’s balance and structure coupled with its bright acidity makes it an age-worthy wine to be enjoyed for several years. Enjoy this beauty with a succulent roasted chicken and wild mushroom risotto.",

        "Mexican on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Dragonette Cellars Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir. It has 4.8 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 45 dollars.",

            "2016 was another in a string of terrific vintages in Santa Barbara. We had another early budbreak, and (unlike 2015) perfect weather during set, allowing for a strong, balanced crop. May, June and July were quite warm and ripening was fairly quick; however, an unseasonably cool August slowed the vines considerably. For the winemaker it was almost ideal, as the grapes were able to complete ripening slowly, without heat spikes, and the grapes maintained excellent acidity. Over a series of cool mornings, we picked each block at near perfect ripeness and balance. The wines appear to have great fruit character, fresh acidity and tannic structure and solid depth. ",

        "Salad on the menu? Try pairing with Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Santan Ema Reserve Chardonnay with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.",
